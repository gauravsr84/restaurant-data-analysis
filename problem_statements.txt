1. Count of ordered dishes branch-wise
2. month-wise sales for all branches
3. average ratings for each branch

hi guys
in this video we are going to see how can we use python and derive meaningful inferences from a restaurant data. This will be a full hands-on exercise, so get yourself ready.

Lets first take a look at the data. We have a restaurant, and it has some 10 branches. Whenever an order is placed, POS captures the following - branch id, cutomer details, order date and time, order details. After the order, customer also gives their ratings. Now for some reason, the total order amount is not captured. I have done this to make the problem statement more realistic. So if we want to calculate month-wise sales for branches, we need to calculate the order amount. And we do it with the help of a base price list. And this is how it looks. So we are going to get the price from the base price csv.

The overall exercise will be done in 8 steps. The steps are displayed on the screen, in case you want to jump to any specific step.
